# 18880-Images-of-466-People-3D-Instance-Segmentation-and-22-Landmarks-Annotation-Data-of-Human-Body


## Description
18,880 Images of 466 People - 3D Instance Segmentation and 22 Landmarks Annotation Data of Human Body. The dataset diversity includes multiple scenes, light conditions, ages, shooting angles, and poses. In terms of annotation, we adpoted instance segmentation annotations on human body. 22 landmarks were also annotated for each human body. The dataset can be used for tasks such as human body instance segmentation and human behavior recognition.

instance segmentation annotation of human body , 22 landmarks annotation of human body

## Accuracy
Accuracy requirement: the mask edge location errors in x and y directions are less than 3 pixels, which is considered as a qualified annotation;  Accuracy requirement of segmentation annotation: the annotation part (each part of mask) is regarded as the unit, the accuracy rate shall be more than 95%; Accuracy requirement of landmark annotation: the annotation part (each landmark) is regarded as the unit, the accuracy rate shall be more than 95%; Annotating accuracy = number of correct annotations / total number of annotations
